## Overview of Project
Improbable Beef is looking for bacteria that can replicate the flavor of meat. They were looking at bacteria cultures from belly buttons of volunteers. I helped to create an easy to use, interactive website with their data so the volunteers can quickly check to see if the bacteria Improbable Beef is looking for is inside their belly buttons.
